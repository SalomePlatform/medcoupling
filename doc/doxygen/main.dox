/*!\mainpage MEDMEM user's guide

\section intro Introduction
This document is the user guide of the %MED SALOME module. The MED
module consists in:

- \ref S1 to manipulate meshes and fields that conform
  to the MED data model. This library can be used in C++ programs as
  in python script for data processing on meshes and fields.
- \ref S2 that exhibits some useful functions of the
  library for a graphical manipulation of data in standard use cases.
- \ref S3 that can be used to process MED data files

\section S1 A library of functions for data processing

The figure below represents the layer structure of the packages of the
library:

The fondamentals consists in three atomic libraries: 

- \ref medcoupling that describes DataStructures used for cross process exchange of meshes and fields. 
- \ref medloader that provides I/O functions to the MED file format
- \ref interptools (INTERP_KERNEL + REMAPPER) that provides
  mathematical structures and algorithms for interpolation and
  localization.

You should be warned that the MEDMEM library still exists in the MED
module but is considered as deprecated:

- \ref medmem covers the %MEDMEM core library, i.e. the implementation
  of meshes, supports and fields and the associated drivers (for
  MED-file, VTK, GIBI).

\section S2 A graphical interface for standard use cases

The MED module in SALOME comes with a graphical interface that helps
you to deal with most standard use case of fields manipulation. The
user guide can be found here:

You could also be interested to read the software specifications and
requirements for this graphical module, and even the technical
considerations for development:

\section S3 A set of tools for file manipulation

- Chapter \ref tools describes various tools based on MEDMEM  that can
be helpful for handling MED files (conversion tools and splitting tools). 

\section install Installation 
The install procedure of the %MED SALOME module can handle a variety of configurations 
to suit the needs of its user. Instructions for configuring and
installing the module an be found in \ref medmem_install.
