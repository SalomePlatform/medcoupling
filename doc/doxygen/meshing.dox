\page meshing MESHING

\section meshing_overview Overview

This class is a class derived from MESH class that is used
to build a MESH object from scratch. 

All verifications are under user responsability : if array values or array 
dimensions are wrong, results are impredictable.
All the arrays passed as arguments in the set methods are duplicated in MESHING object.

The creation of a mesh should respect the following sequence :
- setting general information (name, description, coordinate system, ...),
- setting the nodes (number and coordinates),
- setting the connectivity (types, connectivity arrays,...),
- group creations.

The following paragraphs describe the methods that must be called 
when creating a mesh. An example illustrates the general procedure.
The specific case of \c MED_POLYGON and \c MED_POLYHEDRA
elements requires some methods that are described in \ref polygon.

\section outline_meshing Outline

The following sections point to various groups of MESHING methods :
- Constructors : \ref MESHING_constructors,
- General information : \ref MESHING_general,
- Setting nodes : \ref MESHING_nodes,
- Connectivity : \ref MESHING_connectivity,
- Groups : \ref MESHING_group.

An example of mesh creation via MESHING is given in :
- C++ :
\include MESHINGexample.cxx
- Python:
\include  MESHINGexample.py
