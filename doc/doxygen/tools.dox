\section Introduction
On top of the MEDMEM library, MEDMEM comes with a few executables that
are based on the MEDMEM library and that help the user to perform
common operations on MED files :
- conversion to other formats,
- splitting of a %MED file to a parallel %MED file distributed over a
number of subdomains.

\section medsplitter MEDSPLITTERtool

The purpose of  MEDSPLITTER is to split MED files into
a series of other MED files forming a partition of the original MED
files. It can either work with serial meshes (1 to n) or distributed
meshes (p to n). For serial meshes, it accepts MED files from the 2.1
version onwards. For distributed MED files, it accepts MED files from
the 2.3 version onwards. 

There exists a parallel version of MEDSPLITTER, which accepts
distributed MED files only. In contrast to the ordinary MEDSPLITTER
the parallel one distributes several usual MED files composing the
whole model among available processors. After the
partitioning, each processor writes only it's own part of the
distributed MED file. The parallel MEDSPLITTER processes meshes only,
not fields.

It can be used either as an executable, \a medsplitter (or \a
medsplitter_para) or as a library. The partitioning is made thanks to
one of the following library : 
- METIS (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis/index.html)
- SCOTCH (http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/scotch_fr.html)

The arguments to the medsplitter tool can be retrieved by calling :
\code
medsplitter --help
\endcode
or
\code
medsplitter_para --help
\endcode

For Salome V4.1.0, one gets the following arguments (some of them are
unavailable in parallel version):

\code
Available options:
        --help                 : produces this help message
        --mesh-only            : do not create the fields contained in the original file(s)
        --distributed          : specifies that the input file is distributed
        --input-file=<string>  : name of the input MED file
        --output-file=<string> : name of the resulting file
        --meshname=<string>    : name of the input mesh (not used with --distributed option)
        --ndomains=<number>    : number of subdomains in the output file, default is 1
        --plain-master         : creates a plain masterfile instead of an XML file
        --creates-boundary-faces: creates the necessary faces so that faces joints are created in the output files
        --family-splitting     : preserves the family names instead of focusing on the groups
\endcode

\section renumber RENUMBER tool

The purpose of RENUMBER is to renumber the cell of a mesh in order to
make numerical computation easier. This tool works with meshes
which contain only one cell type and can renumber it according to two
different methods:
- Reverse Cuthill McKee (with the Boost Graph Library http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html)
- Nested Dissection (with the METIS library
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis/index.html)

It can be used in this way :
\code
renumber MEDFile_in MeshName Method[BOOST/METIS] MEDFile_out
\endcode

\section sauv2med sauv2med tool

The sauv2med tool enable conversion from a Cast3m \a sauv file into a
MED file. It is a python script that encapsulates the read/write
drivers provided by the MEDMEM library.

Calling 
\code
sauv2med myfile.sauv
\endcode
generates a \a med file named \a myfile.sauv.med

\section med2sauv med2sauv tool

med2sauv operator is the operator that is inverse of sauv2med. Its
behaviour is symmetrical. 

Calling 
\code
med2sauv myfile.med
\endcode
generates a \a sauv file named \a myfile.med.sauv
