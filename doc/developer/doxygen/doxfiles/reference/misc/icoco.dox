\page icoco The ICoCo API

ICoCo stands for <b>Interface for COde COupling</b>. 

It is a pure abstract API defining a standard way for two physical codes to exchange 
information between them.

The full definition of this interface is held in the opensource TRUST plaform repository 
(sub-folder Outils/src/LIBICOCOAPI) that can be found here: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/trust-platform

The MEDCoupling library provides the implementation of the <b>ICoCo::MEDDoubleField</b> and 
<b>ICoCo::MEDIntField</b> classes used in some of the field exchange methods. We also provide
the sequential and parallel interpolation tools which are often needed in such coupling (see
\ref interpolation and \ref para-dec respectively)

<b>WARNING: currently, no implementation of the ICoCo::MEDStringField object is provided yet, you are welcome
to propose one if you need it.</b>

<b>Note:</b> some class names have been changed in version 9.7, take a look at \ref porting_icoco
