# This illustrates the use of getValueOn in the case of hexahedron
# meshes (for which a temporary limitation implies the usage of the
# method simplexize that split the hexahedron into simplex,
# i.e. triangles and tetrahedrons).

# WARN: In the current version of MEDCoupling, the getValueOn works

# interpolation to be performed in the case of other cells, in
# particular in the case of hexahedron meshes.
#
# A temporary solution (with good numerical results) is to split
# hexahedrons into simplex (before the association of the mesh to the
# field) using the method simplexize.
