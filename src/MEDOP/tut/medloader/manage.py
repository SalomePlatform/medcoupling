# Q: use a list of structures whose an attribute could be a
# MEDCoupling field? Or a tree that you cross using attribute and
# whose leaves are the MEDCoupling fields?
# R: I think that the default structure should be a simple list that
# store objects whith properties that corresponds to the metadata (and
# if loaded the MEDCouplingField or Mesh). Then for specific request,
# a BTree could be create to organize the search (for example if we
# request all the fields for a given iteration step, then we should
# use the iteration step as a first classifaction switch of the tree
